# FAI Coursework One
# Introduction

Coursework 1 studies the python implementation of `Route Finding Problem` and `8 Puzzle Problems` program which is adapted from AIMA. The questions are on your understanding of concept of search algorithms (uninformed and informed) and their implementation. Students are expected to master the knowledge of formulating problems and using tree searching algorithms to solve them. Students are also required to evluate search algorithms under different setting.  The main goal is to give you first-hand experience on implementing search techniques for solving the two problems in Python, one of the mostly adapted high level languages and analytic tools in business and research.
